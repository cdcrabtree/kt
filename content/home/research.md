Professor Tsutsui’s research interests lie in political/comparative sociology, social movements, globalization, human rights, and Japanese society. More specifically, he has conducted (1) cross-national quantitative analyses on how human rights ideas and instruments have expanded globally and impacted local politics and (2) qualitative case studies of the impact of global human rights on Japanese politics. His current projects examine (a) changing conceptions of nationhood and minority rights in national constitutions and in practice, (b) populism and the future of democracy, (c) experimental surveys on public understanding about human rights, (d) campus policies and practices around human rights, (e) global expansion of corporate social responsibility and its impact on corporate behavior, and (f) Japan’s public diplomacy and perceptions about Japan in the world.

His research on the globalization of human rights and its impact on local politics has appeared in American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, Social Problems, Journal of Peace Research, Journal of Conflict Resolution, and other social science journals. His book publications include [_Rights Make Might: Global Human Rights and Minority Social Movements in Japan_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/rights-make-might-9780190853112?cc=us&lang=en&#) (Oxford University Press 2018), and two co-edited volumes [_Corporate Social Responsibility in a Globalizing World_](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cambridge.org/US/academic/subjects/sociology/political-sociology/corporate-social-responsibility-globalizing-world%23contentsTabAnchor&source=gmail&ust=1594448525055000&usg=AFQjCNG1UTsVgto3Ob48XktpVF2q_V-JLQ) (with [Alwyn Lim](https://www.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/149941/Alwyn-LIM), Cambridge University Press 2015) and _The Courteous Power: Japan and Southeast Asia in the Indo-Pacific Era_ (with [John Ciorciari](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~johncior/), University of Michigan Press, forthcoming). He has been a recipient of National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, National Science Foundation grants, the SSRC/CGP Abe Fellowship, Stanford Japan Studies Postdoctoral Fellowship, and other grants as well as awards from American Sociological Association sections on Global and Transnational Sociology (2010, 2013, 2019), Human Rights (2017, 2019), Asia and Asian America (2018, 2019), Collective Behavior and Social Movements (2018), and Political Sociology (2019).
