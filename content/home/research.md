Professor Tsutsui's research interests lie in political/comparative sociology, social movements, globalization, human rights, and Japanese society. More specifically, he has conducted (1) cross-national quantitative analyses on how human rights ideas and instruments have expanded globally and impacted local politics and (2) qualitative case studies of the impact of global human rights on Japanese politics. His current projects examine a) changing conceptions of nationhood and minority rights in national constitutions and their impact on actual practices, b) global expansion of corporate social responsibility and its impact on corporate behavior, c) experimental surveys on public understanding about human rights, and d) campus policies and practices around human rights.

His research on globalization of human rights and its impact on local politics has appeared in _American Sociological Review_, _American Journal of Sociology_, _Social Forces_, _Social Problems_, _Journal of Peace Research_, _Journal of Conflict Resolution_, and other social science journals. He has also published [_Rights Make Might: Global Human Rights and Minority Social Movements in Japan_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/rights-make-might-9780190853112?cc=us&lang=en&#) (Oxford University Press), and a co-edited volume (with Alwyn Lim) called [_Corporate Social Responsibility in a Globalizing World_](http://www.cambridge.org/US/academic/subjects/sociology/political-sociology/corporate-social-responsibility-globalizing-world#contentsTabAnchor) (Cambridge University Press 2015). He has been a recipient of National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, National Science Foundation grants, the SSRC/CGP Abe Fellowship, Stanford Japan Studies Postdoctoral Fellowship, and other grants as well as awards from American Sociological Association sections on Global and Transnational Sociology (2010, 2013), Human Rights (2017), Asia and Asian America (2018), and Collective Behavior and Social Movements (2018).
